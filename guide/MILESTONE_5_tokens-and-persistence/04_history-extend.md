# M5 · Step 04 of 9 — History captures all three settings
> Nav: [← Apply tokens](03_apply-extend.md) · [Overview](00_overview.md) · [Save sets →](05_storage.md)

## Why / design
`src/theme/history.ts` is the **non-destructive backbone** ([decision-log.md D1](../foundation/decision-log.md#d1--non-destructive-backbone-is-load-bearing)):
before every apply it snapshots the *current* settings, so Revert can restore them exactly and Reset can delete
them. M2 built it for **chrome only**. Now that an apply also writes tokens + semantic (step 03), the snapshot has
to capture all three — otherwise Revert would restore the old chrome but leave your new token colors stuck, and
Reset would delete chrome but orphan the token settings. Same mental model, widened: **snapshot everything you're
about to write.**

The mechanism is unchanged from M2:
- `capture()` reads each setting's current **global** value via `config.inspect(key)?.globalValue` (which is
  `undefined` when the user hasn't set it — the correct "nothing was here" marker).
- `restore(snap)` writes each value back. Writing `undefined` **removes** the key (that's how Reset deletes
  customizations rather than blanking them).
- `apply(fn)` pushes a snapshot, then runs the write; `revert()` pops and restores; `reset()` restores the
  all-`undefined` snapshot and clears the stack.

> This is API you already met in M2 (`inspect().globalValue`, `update(key, undefined, target)` to delete).
> M5 only adds two fields to the `Snapshot` and two lines each in `capture`/`restore`. No new concept — reuse.

Note both token settings live under the `editor` section, so `capture`/`restore` reuse one `editor` config object
(`ed`) for both — one `getConfiguration('editor')` call, two keys.

## Do this
This step edits **one file**: `src/theme/history.ts` — the M2 file. The mechanism is unchanged; you're widening the
import, adding two fields to `Snapshot`, and adding two lines each to `capture()`/`restore()`. `apply`, `revert`,
and `depth` stay **exactly** as M2 wrote them (don't re-type them). (The complete file is in
[the M5 checkpoint](09_verify.md) under `### src/theme/history.ts`.)

> **Before you start:** M2's `src/theme/history.ts` must exist with the `ThemeHistory` class
> (`capture`/`restore`/`apply`/`revert`/`reset`/`depth`) capturing **chrome only**, and step 01's types in place.

1. Open `src/theme/history.ts`.
2. **Widen the import** from `./settings` to include `TOKENS` and `SEMANTIC` alongside `CHROME, TARGET`. Replace the
   `./settings` import line with:
   ```ts
   import { CHROME, TOKENS, SEMANTIC, TARGET } from './settings';
   ```
3. **Extend the `Snapshot` interface** to carry all three settings:
   ```ts
   interface Snapshot { chrome: unknown; tokens: unknown; semantic: unknown; }
   ```
4. **Replace `capture()`** so it also reads an `editor` config and captures `tokens` + `semantic` globalValues
   (both token settings live under `editor`, so one `ed` config serves both):
   ```ts
     private capture(): Snapshot {
       const wb = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(CHROME.section);
       const ed = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(TOKENS.section);
       return {
         chrome: wb.inspect(CHROME.key)?.globalValue,
         tokens: ed.inspect(TOKENS.key)?.globalValue,
         semantic: ed.inspect(SEMANTIC.key)?.globalValue,
       };
     }
   ```
5. **Replace `restore()`** so it writes all three back (chrome via the workbench config, tokens + semantic via the
   editor config):
   ```ts
     private async restore(s: Snapshot): Promise<void> {
       const wb = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(CHROME.section);
       const ed = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(TOKENS.section);
       await wb.update(CHROME.key, s.chrome, TARGET);
       await ed.update(TOKENS.key, s.tokens, TARGET);
       await ed.update(SEMANTIC.key, s.semantic, TARGET);
     }
   ```
6. **Confirm `reset()`** passes all-`undefined` for the three fields (so it deletes every customization):
   ```ts
     async reset(): Promise<void> {
       await this.restore({ chrome: undefined, tokens: undefined, semantic: undefined });
       this.stack = [];
     }
   ```
7. Leave `apply`, `revert`, and `depth` unchanged. Save.

**Load-bearing:** the three `Snapshot` fields must line up with the three settings; `restore` writing `undefined`
is what makes Reset *delete* keys. The private method names are cosmetic.

## Done when (this step)
- `src/theme/history.ts` matches the checkpoint version and the project compiles clean.
- Behavior is verified in step 09: after applying a themed set (chrome + tokens + semantic), **Revert** restores
  the previous state of *all three* settings, and **Reset** removes all three from `settings.json` entirely.

## If it breaks
- **Revert restores chrome but token colors stay** → `capture`/`restore` didn't get the `tokens`/`semantic`
  lines, or they read/write the wrong section. Both token settings are under `editor` (the `ed` config).
- **Reset blanks colors instead of removing the keys** → you passed `{}` (empty object) instead of `undefined`;
  only `undefined` deletes a key. Confirm `reset()` passes `undefined` for all three.
- **Language-scoped applies don't get reverted** → expected and out of scope: this snapshot captures **global**
  values (`globalValue`). Per-language overrides live in `"[languageId]"` blocks; Revert here targets the global
  settings. (Reset the language block by re-applying globally, or clear it manually — noted, not a defect.)
