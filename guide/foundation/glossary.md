# Glossary — Van Code (VS Code extension)

> Terms the guide introduces, defined in plain language. Ordered alphabetically. Each step defines a term
> inline on first use, then links here. Terms are seeded from the plan; step links are filled as milestones draft.

### Activity Bar
The vertical strip of icons on the far edge of the VS Code window; clicking an icon opens its View Container. *(Introduced in M1.)*

### Chrome (workbench chrome)
The editor's surrounding UI (title bar, activity bar, sidebar, status bar, tabs, panels) as opposed to the code text; recolored via `workbench.colorCustomizations`. *(Introduced in M2.)*

### `ConfigurationTarget`
The enum choosing *where* a settings write lands: `Global` (User settings, all workspaces) or `Workspace`/`WorkspaceFolder`. *(Introduced in M2.)*

### Contrast ratio (WCAG)
A number from 1:1 to 21:1 describing how distinguishable two colors are; AA text wants ≥ 4.5:1, AAA wants ≥ 7:1. *(Introduced in M3.)*

### Custom set
A user-saved, named theme (the full set of color customizations) persisted by the extension and shown in "My sets". *(Introduced in M5.)*

### Extension Development Host
The second VS Code window that opens when you press F5, running your in-development extension. *(Introduced in M1.)*

### Generative profile
A style whose full palette is *derived* from a seed color by the profile's rules (e.g. Neon, Pastel). *(Introduced in M3.)*

### HSL
A color model of Hue (0–360°), Saturation (%), Lightness (%); easier than RGB for deriving coordinated palettes. *(Introduced in M3.)*

### Seed color
The single base color a generative profile expands into a full coordinated palette. *(Introduced in M3.)*

### Semantic token
A code token classified by the language's semantic-tokens provider (e.g. "this identifier is a parameter"), recolored via `editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations`; only applies when a provider is active and the theme opts in. *(Introduced in M5.)*

### Signature preset
A style with a fixed identity palette rather than a seed-derived one (e.g. Game Boy, Synthwave). *(Introduced in M4.)*

### Snapshot
A saved copy of the color settings taken *before* an apply, so the change can be reverted exactly. *(Introduced in M2.)*

### Starter combination
One of the 5 base 5-color palettes (bg / surface / text / accent1 / accent2) the reader picks as a starting point. *(Introduced in M3.)*

### Style profile
The data object (rules or fixed values) defining one of the 13 styles; collected in one registry. *(Introduced in M3.)*

### TextMate scope
A dotted name (e.g. `comment.line`, `keyword.control`) identifying a class of syntax tokens, targeted by `editor.tokenColorCustomizations`. *(Introduced in M5.)*

### View Container
A grouping in the Activity Bar (or panel) that holds one or more Views; contributed via `contributes.viewsContainers`. *(Introduced in M1.)*

### Webview View
A View whose content is an HTML/JS page (a mini web app) rather than a tree; our sidebar panel, contributed with `"type": "webview"`. *(Introduced in M1.)*

### Workbench color key
One of VS Code's named themeable UI colors (e.g. `statusBar.background`) settable under `workbench.colorCustomizations`. *(Introduced in M2.)*
